----- git branch & merge -----
Branch is a new and separate branch of the master repo.
In a big project we separate the tasks / features and create branch so 
editing in the new branch does not affect the master branch.

master --> git branch dev/git checkout dev --> new & separate branch of master repo
--> git checkout master / git merge dev .

Branch -> Reviews -> Testing -> merge
Command: 
git branch    === for check local branch
git branch -r === for check remote branch
git branch -a === check local or remote branch
